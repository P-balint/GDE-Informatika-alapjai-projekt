# Introduction

This project has two primary goals: to learn something new and to create a useful resource for my fellow students. As I was already familiar with Google Sites, I wanted a more challenging platform so I chose GitHub Pages. Although it offers templates similar to Google Sites, using it involves more complexity due to Jekyll, a static site generator that requires local setup. Additionally, customizing Jekyll requires HTML and CSS knowledge. Gaining some familiarity with those will come in handy in the future.

Second, I wanted to create something useful to help my fellow students out. Some of them might not have any existing foundations in programming, or even know how to set up a local development environment. I've created the [Python setup](python_setup.markdown) specifically for them. In addition, I've listed some [useful resources](useful_resources.markdown) which can come in handy in addition the course materials. Even if we might've already learned or will learn those things, repetition is the mother of retention.
