|Course|Description|
|------|-----------|
|[CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science (CS50X)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)|Covers a wide range of topics, giving solid foundations. Starts with C, which is not the simplest language. "More comfortable" problem sets can give a good challenge.|
|[CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)|Focuses on getting up and running with Python. Generally easier than CS50X, but doesn't focus on the fundamentals so much. It's recommended to do both. |
|[CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL (CS50 SQL)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/)|Gives a solid foundation in database design utilizing SQL (SQLite).|
