# About

The aim of this site is to showcase our understanding of web development fundamentals, including HTML, CSS, as part of the Informatika alapjai course at [GDE](https://gde.hu/). This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and was created by customizing the [Hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) Jekyll theme. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator built with Ruby, and most of the styling is automatically handled by it. However, we've added custom HTML and SCSS to enhance the design.
